Python data structures for representing and creating music

### Description
The contained modules provide the basis for creating music with Python using
basic signals (such as those from older 8-bit music). The musical objects can be
compiled into waveforms which can then be written to .wav files or played
through the program.

### Dependencies
This project was developed entirely in Python3. Dependencies required are
included in the dependencies.txt
